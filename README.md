# mockdesk [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/mockdesk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/mockdesk)

Desktop application for creating mockups

This was constructed out of frustration due to the lack of mockup tools for Linux as well as their feature incompleteness.

## Proprietary notice
We are still undecided on whether to license this freely or to make this a proprietary product. This is being constructed during would-be professional employment time and is blocking desired activities. As a result, we are torn between requesting for compensation and making an open product (from our experience, the donation model works very poorly).

For now, feel free to browse the source but usage of this code in any environment is prohibited. If you have any feedback on this topic, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/twolfson/mockdesk/issues/new).

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install mockdesk`

```js
var mockdesk = require('mockdesk');
mockdesk(); // 'awesome'
```

## Contributing
